2nd Year - 3rd and 4th semester ,
3rd Year - 5th and 6th semester


## Third Year

#### 6th Sem
- [EC-691 CONTROL_INSTRUMENTATION_LAB](https://github.com/MeheliR/Btech-ECE-labs/tree/main/6TH%20SEMESTER/EC391_CONTROL_INSTRUMENTATION_LAB)
### Experiments

- Familiarization with MATLAB control system toolbox and representation of pole zero and transfer function of control system.

- Determination of transfer function of a given system from its state model and its vice-versa.

- Determination of impulse & step response for 2nd order under damped system on CRO & calculation of control system specifications for variation of system design.

- Determination of root Locus from transfer function and evaluation of system parameters like marginal value of gain, frequency etc. of a given control system.

- Drawing of Nyquist plot and Bode plot from transfer function of a control system and estimation of relative system parameters like gain margin, phase margin etc.

- Design Pl, PD and PID controller for specified system requirements. 
- Study of static (accuracy, precision, repeatability, linearity) and dynamic (fidelity, speed of response) characteristics of a measuring instrument.

- Design and study of Instrumentation Amplifier.

- Study and analysis of electrical signal with CRO.
