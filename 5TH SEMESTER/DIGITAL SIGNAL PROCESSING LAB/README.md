### Experiments

- Simulation Laboratory using standard Simulator: 

    
     1. Sampled sinusoidal signal, various sequences and different arithmetic operations.

     2. Convolution of two sequences using graphical methods and using commands verification of the properties of convolution.

     3. Z-transform of various sequences - verification of the properties of Z-transform. 
     4. Twiddle factors-verification of the properties.

     5. DFTS/IDFTs using matrix multiplication and also using commands. 
     6. Circular convolution of two sequences using graphical methods and using commands,differentiation between linear and circularconvolutions. 
     7. Verifications of the different algorithms associated with filtering of long data sequences and Overlap -add and Overlap-save methods.
