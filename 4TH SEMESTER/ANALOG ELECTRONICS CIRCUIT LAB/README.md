### Experiments

- Conduct experiment to test diode clipping (single/double ended) and clamping circuits 

- Design and set up the following rectifiers with and without filters and to determine ripple factor(positive/negative).(a). Full Wave Rectifier (b). Bridge Rectifier 

- Design and set up the BJT common emitter amplifier using voltage divider bias with and rectifier efficiency: without feedback and determine the gain- bandwidth product from its frequency response.

- Set-up and study the working of complementary symmetry class B push pull power amplifier and calculate the efficiency

- Realize BIT Darlington Emitter follower with and without bootstrapping and determine gain, input and output impedances.

- Conduct an experiment on Series Voltage Regulator using Zener diode and power transistor to determine line and load regulation characteristics.

- Design and set-up the following tuned oscillator circuits using BJT, and determine the frequency of oscillation. R-C Phase shift Oscillator/Wien Bridge Oscillator .

- Plot the transfer and drain characteristics of n-channel MOSFET and calculate its parameters, namely; drain resistance, mutual conductance and amplification factor.

- Design, setup and plot the frequency response of Common Source IFET/MOSFET amplifier and obtain the bandwidth.
